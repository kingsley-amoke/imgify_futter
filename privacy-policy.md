### Device Information
We may automatically collect certain technical information from your device, including:
- Device type and model
- Operating system version

This information is collected solely to improve app functionality and user experience.

### Permissions Required

#### Storage/Photo Library Access

### Hosting Provider
Our backend servers are hosted by a third-party cloud service provider. These providers have access to server infrastructure but cannot view or access your images as they are deleted immediately after processing.

### Crash Reporting (If Implemented)
We may use crash reporting services to identify and fix bugs. These services may collect anonymous technical data about app crashes.

**Note**: We do not use any third-party advertising networks or analytics services that track user behavior across apps.
